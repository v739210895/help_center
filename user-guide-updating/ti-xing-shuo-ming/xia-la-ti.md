### Option Association

Option association means that the options selected (or not selected) by the respondent will appear as options in the next question. This is generally used in cases where two questions are highly related or in follow-up questions.

{% endcontent-ref %}

### Random options

In the question editing mode, you can set options to be randomized. Once set successfully, the options will be displayed on the answering end according to the selected randomization method. The randomization methods include: random order, random forward and reverse order, and grouped display.

#### Randomize options

Option randomization refers to presenting the options in a question in a random order when answering. Once the "Option Randomization" feature is enabled, a "Not Random" checkbox will appear on the right side of each option. If you wish to keep a particular option in its current position, you can check the "Not Random" box, and that option will not be included in the randomization.

#### Options in random forward and reverse order

Random forward/reverse order of options means that the options in the question will appear in a random forward or reverse order when answering. After enabling the "Random forward/reverse order of options" feature, a "Fix the last option" toggle will appear below the "Random forward/reverse order of options" feature. If you wish to keep the last option fixed in its current position, you can enable the "Fix the last option" feature, so that the last option will not participate in the random forward/reverse order when displayed on the answering end.

#### Grouped display of options

Option grouping display refers to freely dividing options into multiple groups, and during the survey, one or more options from each group are randomly selected for display, supporting random sorting display between groups.
