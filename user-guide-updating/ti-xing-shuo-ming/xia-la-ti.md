### Random options

In the question editing mode, you can setchoices to be randomized. Once set successfully, the choices will be displayed on the answering end according to the selected randomization method. The randomization methods include: random order, random forward and reverse order, and grouped display.

#### Randomize choices

Choice randomization refers to presenting the choices in a question in a random order when answering. Once the "Choice Randomization" feature is enabled, a "Not Random" checkbox will appear on the right side of each option. If you wish to keep a particular choice in its current position, you can check the "Not Random" box, and that choice will not be included in the randomization.

#### Choices in random forward and reverse order

Random forward/reverse order of options means that the choices in the question will appear in a random forward or reverse order when answering. After enabling the "Random forward/reverse order of choices" feature, a "Fix the last choice" toggle will appear below the "Random forward/reverse order of choices" feature. If you wish to keep the last choice fixed in its current position, you can enable the "Fix the last choice" feature, so that the last choice will not participate in the random forward/reverse order when displayed on the answering end.
