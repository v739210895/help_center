# Information Bar

In surveys, it is often necessary to categorize or further elaborate on the questions. Information sections can add textual descriptions between questions, allowing respondents to understand the content of the survey more clearly and intuitively.

## 【STEP 1】 New Information Bar

In the survey editing page, select "Information Bar" from the question type controls on the left side, or click the + button in the quick toolbar on the right side of the specified question to choose "Information Bar" to create a new information bar.

## 【STEP 2】Edit title, notes, and choice content

The title, choices, and remarks all support rich text editing, including font styles, inserting hyperlinks, inserting images, inserting videos, and quoting option content.
