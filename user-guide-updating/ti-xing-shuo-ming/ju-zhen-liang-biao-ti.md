Support setting exception items:

After enabling the exception item feature, you can customize the display text for exception items. Exception items are not counted towards the valid response count and are not scored.

### Prompt method

The prompt method is to set scale prompts, with the left prompt corresponding to the lowest score and the right prompt corresponding to the highest score; when the scale is displayed in reverse order, the prompts will also be displayed in reverse order accordingly.

### Question relevance

Question association allows the selected (or unselected) options by the respondent to be displayed in the questions of this matrix scale question. It is generally used in cases where two questions are highly related or for follow-up questions.

### Questions are randomized

In the question editing state, you can set the questions in the matrix scale question to display randomly. Once set successfully, the questions will be displayed according to the selected random method on the survey end. The random methods for questions in the matrix scale question include: random order, random forward and reverse order.

#### Random order of questions

Question randomization refers to the questions in the matrix scale appearing in random order when answering. After enabling the "question randomization" feature, a non-random checkbox will appear on the right side of each question. If you want a specific question to remain in its current position, you can check "non-random" next to it, and that question will not be included in the randomization.

### Choices are randomized

In the question editing mode, you can set choices to be randomized. Once successfully set, the score will be displayed on the answering end according to the chosen randomization method. The randomization methods for the matrix scale choices include: random forward and reverse order, and score inversion.

#### Choice are randomly ordered in forward or reverse sequence

Random ordering of choices refers to the scores in the questions appearing in random ascending/descending order when answering, for example: respondent A sees the scores as 12345, while respondent B sees the scores as 54321.

#### Score Reversal

Score reversal refers to the presentation of a scale in reverse order when answering questions, i.e., from the highest score to the lowest score, with the prompts displayed in the corresponding reverse order.

{% hint style="info" %}
When the exceptions are enabled, they are fixedly displayed on the right side.
{% endhint %}



Matrix scale questions will adaptively display as a matrix or split questions based on the answering terminal.

## Survey Results

In the statistical analysis page, display the response results of the matrix single-choice question in the form of table subtotal + bar percentage.

{% hint style="info" %}
Anomalies are not included in the valid response count and are not included in the average score.
{% endhint %}
