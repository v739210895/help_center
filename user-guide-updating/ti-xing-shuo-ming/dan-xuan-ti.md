### Choices Listing

In the question editing state, you can set the choices to be displayed in columns. Once set, the answer interface will display the choices in columns according to the number of choices per row. In landscape mode, you can set 1 to 6 choices per row, and in portrait mode, you can set 1 to 3 choices per row. This is suitable for situations where there are many options and the choice text is not long.

### Choices are random

In the question editing mode, choices can be set to random. Once set successfully, the choices will be displayed randomly on the answering end according to the chosen random method. The random methods include: random order, random forward and reverse order, and grouped display.

#### Randomize choices

Random choice ordering means that the choices in a question appear in a random order when answering. After enabling the "Random choice ordering" feature, a non-random checkbox will appear on the right side of the choices. If you want a specific option to remain in its current position, you can check "Non-random" next to it, and that choice will not participate in the random ordering.

#### Choices in random forward and reverse order

Random forward/reverse order of choices means that the choices in the question will randomly appear in forward or reverse order when answering. After enabling the "Random forward/reverse order of choices" feature, a "Fix the last choice" toggle will appear below the "Random forward/reverse order of choices" feature. If you want the last choice to remain in its current position, you can enable the "Fix the last choice" feature, and the last choice will not participate in the random forward/reverse order when displayed on the answering end.
