## 【STEP 3】Title, Questions, and Choices Setup

### Mandatory settings

After turning off the "This question is mandatory" feature in the right panel, this question can be left blank when answering.

{% hint style="info" %}
All questions have the "mandatory" choice enabled by default.
{% endhint %}

### Add a fill-in-the-blank box after the choices

After enabling, add a fill-in-the-blank box behind the choice. Check the required field, and the user must fill in the content before submitting. This is suitable for scenarios where users select other choices and need to collect additional related information.

### Choice Association

Choice association allows the selected (or unselected) choices to be displayed as choices in this matrix single-choice . It is generally used in situations where two questions are highly relevant or for follow-up questions.

In the question editing state,choices can be set to random. Once successfully set, the choices will be displayed in the answer interface according to the chosen random method. The randomization methods for matrix single-choice questions include: random order and random reverse order.

### Randomize choices

Randomizing choices means that the choicesin the question will appear in a random order when answering. After enabling the "Randomize Options" feature, a non-random checkbox will appear to the right of the choices. If you want a certain option to remain in its current position, you can check "Non-random" next to it, and that choice will not be included in the random sorting.

### Choices in random forward and reverse order

Random forward/reverse order of options means that the options in the question appear in a random forward or reverse order when answering. After enabling the "Random forward/reverse order of options" feature, a "Fix the last option" switch will appear below it. If you want the last option to remain in its current position, you can enable the "Fix the last option" feature. In this case, the last option will not participate in the random forward/reverse order when displayed on the answering end.

### Question correlation

Question association means that the choices selected (or not selected) by the respondent are displayed in the questions of this matrix single-choice question. It is generally used in cases where the two questions are highly related or in follow-up questions.

### Questions are random

In the question editing state, you can set the questions in a matrix single-choice survey to be displayed randomly. Once set, the questions will be displayed in the response interface according to the selected random method. The random methods for questions in a matrix single-choice survey include: random order and random forward/reverse order.

### Random order of questions

Question randomization refers to the questions in the matrix single-choice question appearing in a random order when answering. After enabling the "question randomization" feature, a non-random checkbox will appear on the right side of each question. If you want a particular question to remain in its current position, you can check the "non-random" box next to it, and that question will not be included in the randomization.
