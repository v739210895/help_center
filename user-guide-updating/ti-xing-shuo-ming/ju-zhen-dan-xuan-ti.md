In the question editing state,choices can be set to random. Once successfully set, the choices will be displayed in the answer interface according to the chosen random method. The randomization methods for matrix single-choice questions include: random order and random reverse order.

### Randomize choices

Randomizing choices means that the choicesin the question will appear in a random order when answering. After enabling the "Randomize Options" feature, a non-random checkbox will appear to the right of the choices. If you want a certain option to remain in its current position, you can check "Non-random" next to it, and that choice will not be included in the random sorting.

### Choices in random forward and reverse order

Random forward/reverse order of options means that the options in the question appear in a random forward or reverse order when answering. After enabling the "Random forward/reverse order of options" feature, a "Fix the last option" switch will appear below it. If you want the last option to remain in its current position, you can enable the "Fix the last option" feature. In this case, the last option will not participate in the random forward/reverse order when displayed on the answering end.
