### Choices are random

In the question editing mode, you can set the choices to be random. Once set successfully, the choices will be displayed in the answering interface according to the selected random method. The random methods include: random order, random forward and reverse order, and grouped display.

## Randomize choices

Random choice ordering means that the choices in the question appear in a random order when answering. After enabling the "random choice ordering" feature, a non-random checkbox will appear on the right side of the choices. If you want a certain choice to remain in its current position, you can check "non-random" after it, and that choice will not be included in the random ordering.

## Random forward and reverse order of choices

Randomizing the order of choices means that the choices in the questions will appear in either ascending or descending order randomly. When the "Randomize Choices Order" feature is enabled, a "Fix the Last Choice" switch will appear below it. If you wish to keep the last choice in its current position, you can enable the "Fix the Last Choice" feature, and the last choice will not be included in the randomization of the order.
