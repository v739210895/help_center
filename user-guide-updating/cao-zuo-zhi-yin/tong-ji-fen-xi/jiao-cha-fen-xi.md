# Cross analysis

The statistics page supports defining rows and columns for cross-analysis, allowing for real-time and rapid generation of cross tables to analyze the relationships between multiple questions.

Use the questions in the survey as variables, set independent and dependent variables, and then conduct a cross-analysis.

* Define row headers: Generally sample attributes such as gender, age, etc.; up to 20 independent variables can be set.
* Define the list header: Generally, these are the topics that need to be analyzed, such as preference categories, game frequency, payment status, etc. A maximum of 20 dependent variables can be set.

## 【STEP 1】Data filtering

Provide data filtering functionality. Once enabled, specific conditions can be set to filter the currently collected survey data first, and then generate a cross-tabulation from the filtered results.

## 【STEP 2】Set rows, list headers

In the settings panel on the left, select the questions to be used as row headers and column headers, then click the "Start Calculation" button below to generate the crosstab in real-time.
