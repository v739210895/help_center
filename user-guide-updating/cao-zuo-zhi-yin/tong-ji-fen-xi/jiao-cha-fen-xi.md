# Cross analysis

The statistics page supports defining rows and columns for cross-analysis, allowing for real-time and rapid generation of cross tables to analyze the relationships between multiple questions.

Use the questions in the survey as variables, set independent and dependent variables, and then conduct a cross-analysis.

* Define row headers: Generally sample attributes such as gender, age, etc.; up to 20 independent variables can be set.
* Define the list header: Generally, these are the topics that need to be analyzed, such as preference categories, game frequency, payment status, etc. A maximum of 20 dependent variables can be set.

## 【STEP 1】Data filtering

Provide data filtering functionality. Once enabled, specific conditions can be set to filter the currently collected survey data first, and then generate a cross-tabulation from the filtered results.
