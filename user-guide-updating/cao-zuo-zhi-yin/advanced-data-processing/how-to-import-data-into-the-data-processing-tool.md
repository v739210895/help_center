# How to import data into the data processing tool

In the "Statistics - Chart" section, an entry point for data processing tools is provided. By clicking it, you can trigger the import of data into advanced data processing tools, where you can perform operations such as cleaning, matching, and cross-analysis on the collected data.

Other responsible persons or concerned individuals of this survey can collaborate on data processing. For example, after User A performs data cleaning on the survey, another responsible person, User B, can use the advanced data processing tools to review the cleaning results, adjust the cleaning rules, and re-execute the cleaning.

For surveys with completed data processing tasks, users can choose to directly access previously executed data processing tasks or re-import data upon their second visit. If they choose to re-import data, the system will automatically perform operations such as cleaning, setting variables, and weighting according to the previously saved conditions.

**Special Instructions**

Advanced data processing tools exist as independent tools, with data storage and usage separate from survey data. Data cleaning and other modifications performed in the advanced data processing tools do not affect the original survey data. (This can be understood as two sets of data, with the advanced processing tools being equivalent to an online simplified version of SPSS.)&#x20;

Therefore, if there are any additions, deletions, or changes in the recycling process, the survey data must be re-imported to synchronize the updates with the advanced data processing tools.
