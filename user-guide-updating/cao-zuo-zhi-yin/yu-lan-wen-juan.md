# Preview survey

After editing the survey, you can check the editing results through the preview link, or send the survey link or QR code to others for inspection and confirmation to ensure the accuracy of the editing. The survey supports multi-terminal adaptation, allowing you to directly preview the effects on both computer and mobile devices.

On the survey editing page, click the "Preview" button in the upper right corner or click the item name of the specified survey in the "My Surveys" list to enter the preview page of the survey. This includes two terminal preview effects: "Mobile Preview" and "Computer Preview". It also supports scanning the preview QR code to preview the survey on your mobile phone.

## Question Number Setting Options

To facilitate the inspection of question visibility, the preview page supports toggling between displaying default question numbers and original question numbers. When set to original question numbers, it will display according to the question numbers in the survey editing page.

Switching the question number type only takes effect on the preview page and does not affect the display of question numbers on the answering end.
