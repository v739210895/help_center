# Survey distribution

Survey distribution is mainly applicable to scenarios where the same survey needs to be distributed in multiple languages or versions, allowing respondents to choose and fill out different versions of the survey according to their actual situation. The response data for each survey is independently collected and analyzed.

The management end provides a configuration function for the survey distribution page, which is used to configure the text displayed on multiple buttons on the distribution page (summary page) and the survey that is redirected to after clicking the buttons. The distribution link of the distribution page is used for deployment.

In the "survey distribution" feature, click the "Create New Distribution Task" button in the upper left corner to display the new distribution task popup. Set the task name and prompt in the popup.
