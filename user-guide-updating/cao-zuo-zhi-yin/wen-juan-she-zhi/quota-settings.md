# 🆕 Quota Settings

Quota settings only support single-choice questions, multiple-choice questions, and linked questions (requires address import)

### 【STEP 1】Add Channel

After entering the quota settings, you can first add distribution channels and set quotas for the data collected from each channel (if you do not want to differentiate by channel, simply click next).

### 【STEP 2】Set Quota Questions

Drag the questions from the list on the left to the quota questions on the right to generate a quota.

### 【STEP 3】Set quota amount

Set the quota amount for each option, with the default being 0 for no quota limit.

### 【STEP 4】Check quota progress

After collecting the surveys, you can directly check the quota completion status on the current page.

### Set cross quotas

By setting cross quotas, you can limit the number of times options can be selected based on 2 questions. For example, if you need to collect 10 surveys from male players who like computer games, you can use cross quotas to accomplish this. Set it as shown in the figure below by dragging the questions from the list to the questions that need to participate in the cross quotas.

### Maximum number of valid survey responses

{% hint style="info" %}
Once the number of valid surveys reaches the preset value, the collection will automatically be paused;

It is possible to set a valid survey response volume for each distribution channel separately. Once the valid survey response volume limit is reached for a channel, the link for that channel will automatically pause the collection of responses, while other channels will continue to collect surveys normally.
{% endhint %}

### Add variable

Support custom variables, i.e., recombine question fields to generate new variables. The newly generated variables can participate in quotas or generate cross-quotas with other questions.

After successfully adding, a new variable question will be generated below the question list, and you can drag it to participate in the quota.
