Provide a survey check function to help questionnaire editors optimize question content and research methods, thereby avoiding compliance risks and improving survey completion rates and response quality.<br>

Coverage of Check Dimensions:

1. Question-Type Quantity Control: Triggers a prompt if the number of subjective questions > 4, or the total number of matrix questions > 10.
2. Matrix Question Depth Control: Triggers a prompt if the number of sub‑questions in a single matrix question > 10, or the number of options in a single matrix single/multiple‑choice question > 6.
3. Content Repetition Detection: Triggers a prompt if identical question stems are found, or if duplicate options/sub‑questions exist within a single question.
4. Expression Consistency Detection: Triggers a prompt if the frequency of “您” and “你” in stems, notes, options, and info fields is inconsistent.
