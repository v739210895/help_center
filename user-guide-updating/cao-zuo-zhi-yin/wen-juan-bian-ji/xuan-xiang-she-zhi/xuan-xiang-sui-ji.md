### Randomize choices

Randomize choices means that the choices in a question appear in a random order when answering. After enabling the "Randomize choices" feature, a checkbox labeled "Not random" will appear on the right side of each choice. If you want a specific choice to remain in its current position, you can check "Not random" next to it, and that choice will not be included in the random order.

After enabling the "Choices in ascending or descending order" feature, a "Fix the last choice" toggle will appear below it. If you wish to keep the last choice fixed in its current position, you can enable the "Fix the last choice" feature, and the last choice will not participate in the random forward and reverse order when displayed on the answering end.
