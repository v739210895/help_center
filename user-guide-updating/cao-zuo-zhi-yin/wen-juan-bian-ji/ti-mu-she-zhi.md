# Survey Setup

In the question editing mode, you can configure question settings in the 'Question Settings' panel on the right-hand side.

### Required setting

Disable the "This question is mandatory" feature in the right panel to allow this question to be optional when answering.

{% hint style="info" %}
All questions have the "mandatory" feature enabled by default.
{% endhint %}

### Question Type Switching

Single-choice questions, multiple-choice questions, and dropdown questions can be switched between question types. After switching, the settings for fill-in-the-blank, random order, and mandatory answer will remain unchanged.
