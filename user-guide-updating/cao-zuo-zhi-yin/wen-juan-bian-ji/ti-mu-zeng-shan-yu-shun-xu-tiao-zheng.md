### Frequently Asked Questions

Are there choices for inserting question placeholders and copying questions?

Yes, click on the "+" in the right-side quick toolbar of the previous question to select the type of question you want to insert. This will insert the selected new question below the current question. You can also copy a question, and the copied new question will appear below the current question.

{% hint style="danger" %}
1. Copying the survey does not include copying the original survey's logic settings and choice association settings.
2. Copying may cause subsequent question numbers to change, and the question numbers in the references of other questions need to be dynamically modified.
