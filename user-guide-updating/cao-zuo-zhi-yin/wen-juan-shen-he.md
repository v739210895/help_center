# Survey Review

To avoid risks and ensure the security of project information, regular users need to submit the survey to a designated reviewer for review before distributing it. Once the reviewer approves the survey, the distribution link becomes effective automatically, and the response data can be collected normally.

## List Management

&#x20;The "survey review" list displays all the surveys that need to be reviewed or have been reviewed by the user (as the reviewer). The survey list is sorted in descending order of "Submission Review Time".
